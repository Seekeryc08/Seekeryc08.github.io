            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Heartstrings</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Dec 15, 2014 by <a href="About.html">yc</a></p>

            <p>A couple of things have been bugging me since yesterday:
            <ul>
            <li>Resistance: At work, my To-Do lists, resistance to change</li>
            <li>Self-Doubt: Who am I?</li>
            <li>Blocks- The Fears: Of rejection, of judgement, of failure</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p><em text-align="center";>When you complain, you make yourself a victim. Leave a situation, change a situation, or accept it; all else is madness.</em>
            </p>

            <p>This quote by Eckhart Tolle throws all the excuses I have in order to keep resisting out of the window.
            </p>

            <p>Many times, like today, I find myself habitually resisting, not mindful that I am. That the heavy feeling that is present is due to stupidity on my part. I have been reminded that radical honesty to life is necessary.
            </p>

            <p>I had a dream yesterday night. I have accepted my friend's invitation for a board games gathering this week, and in my dream it was probably the likely scenario created for such an event. I did not wake up feeling refreshed, for it left me really uncomfortable, heavy. I know these are my fears lingering in the background, about to manifest in about whatever I do - the fears of rejection, expression, of other's judgement, the lack of confidence, self-doubt and uncertainty, fear of being undeserving and of failure.
            </p>

            <p>Recently, I felt a little of my Mum's pain. The fact that I decided that I'm an Empath and yet often either couldn't perceive and feel my parents' pain or simply choose to not pay any attention seems quite ridiculous. Maybe I've decided that I couldn't help them since I'm already busy trying to help myself. What if helping them become a greater version of themselves - that is, developing a better relationship with them by letting down the barriers of my ego and being vulnerable and open up to their pain and not giving up on our relationship - helps me become a greater version of myself too?
            </p>

            <p>For maybe the first time in my life, I let down all barriers within and listened emphatically, sitting slumped on the kitchen table with my head relaxed gently against the fridge, to my Mum's heartstrings. It was beautiful; It sounded like a heartbreak song. Her pain could open a new door for me after all, if I do not turn a blind eye to it. Perhaps it could fuel my motivation to succeed and straighten out my life's path to prove her that I could survive well by my own means, and to ease their never ceasing worries and frustrations. The lack of money and survival issues have really done them in in this lifetime. Perhaps it is to forge a connection, an understanding, a newness that has never been there before, between us. The responsibility is mine now. I am in a position to either make a positive change in my parents' lives or let them languish.
            </p>

            <p text-align="center";><em>Every time you feel a judgement or hatred towards another person you remove them from your heart. By indulging and giving energy to the judgement, the chain of separation is perpetuated. Even pretending not to see or ignoring an injustice is a way we close ourselves from the pain of the world. If we really open our eyes, we see the world is hurting, including ourselves. When you can shift to seeing another person's perspective it creates the space for a higher potential and is the beginning of human compassion and moral action. - Leaning into Life</em>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Synchronicity, Mark Twain and TCC</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Dec 8, 2014 by <a href="About.html">yc</a></p>

            <p text-align="center";><em> "Remember who the real enemy is." - Haymitch Abernathy, The Hunger Games</em>
            </p>


            <p text-align="center";><em>We are all lonelier than we think we are.</em>
            </p>


            <p>
            With a firm grip of my cell phone in hand - and a dash of hope, I stood from my seat and made it out of the small, confining room within two swift steps, and the music that has transformed into harmless-in-its-nature yet unwelcome disturbance to my already wounded soul faded immediately in the background. I glanced at the missed call, made my way nonchalantly to the walkway and returned the call, only for the realisation to hit me that I could not be any more significant in a mostly unconscious world where everybody only places their own interests at heart. There are two options - either to blindly engage in their foolishness, fit in like everyone else and live in a way in which whether one's true passion is found, realised, or not is of little priority, or choose the courageous path - the path of danger - that is to walk alone. (By the way, my friend no longer needed to talk, so he said he'd call me back in a while.) A few moments later, I decided that <em>That's it, I'm done and I'm outta here. </em>
            </p>


            <p>
            I might sound a little harsh. Don't get me wrong: Deep down in our hearts, we all long to be useful, passionate, and be a meaningful contribution to the world, and live our lives that way, whether we know it or not. Most of us have yet to find the spark within us. I am on a search for mine, too. 
            </p>

            
            <p>
            Back in that room, the truth was that I struggled, quietly. For a person who is used to not expressing himself freely, I have learnt to shut down my voice from young, but not only that; I have in fact been coping with life's intensities and uncertainties by shutting off the outward expression of my true self. Thus, this pattern has manifested in neck and shoulder tightness, as well as a constriction in my throat, affecting my voice and causing me to be soft-spoken. When it was my turn to sing, I felt like I could hardly be heard no matter how loud I try to sound without breaking my voice or going off pitch (this sounds silly, but it's true). The quality of my voice is nothing compared to others who could make themselves heard without even trying to, let alone strain their voices. Besides, my friends do not seem to be listening. Although I completed my songs, deep down I was rather discouraged. <em>What am I doing here? Why is this happening?</em> I thought I had uncovered a shadow: I am insignificant and undeserving (of love). Insignificant as my voice, expression and contribution could barely be heard. Thus, I do not receive acknowledgement or validation for it, and that makes me undeserving.
            </p>

            <p>
            Usually, in the not-so-distant past, I would be projecting this hurt onto others so that I could blame others for my misery. It would be much easier to have an object to direct my pain and judgements at. I feel compelled to do so and break away from this group as a sign of rejection and choosing to not need them. Then I could walk alone, accompanied by my misery. But I really knew that this is not at all anyone's fault. As I strolled down the walkways of the hotel toward the entrance and was welcomed by the gentle pitter-patter of raindrops outside, I embraced the pain within me as I allowed it to nurture my being.
            </p>

            <p>
            I was taught that mystical, unconditional self-love - which is essentially the process of including and being with whatever thoughts and emotions that arise in the moment - is the essence of healing.
            </p>

            <p>
            I watched my thoughts run as they pondered over how insignificant I was as compared to the entire, vast world around me. At the hotel's entrance on a Sunday afternoon, I stood watching as the cars go by and the streams of pedestrians made their way toward their respective destinations... And I am here. Whether I am still here the next moment or have disappeared without a trace, surely wouldn't have much of an impact on the world. I am after all, just a speck in the universe, and this reality hit me hard today. I am that small, in comparison to the whole world. And the question "What is the meaning of my existence then" came to mind. How are we leading our lives, when we realise we are all so insignificant to the whole? The world goes on without us. What are we really doing on Earth? What are we doing, dragging our feet doing things that are unimportant, dragging ourselves to work, killing time and living passionless, mediocre lives?
            </p>

            <p><em text-align="center";>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. <br/>
- Marianne Williamson</em>
            </p>

            <p>There is one word for this. The word in my mind is Passion.
            </p>

            <p>I joined a Meet Up hiking event yesterday and the people whom I had met and spoke with seem to have something in common - that is the courage to pursue their dreams, and living life not forgetting what their dreams are. 
            </p>

            <p>For most of the trail, I hiked alongside this lady named YL who's four years older, who's an aspiring artist and life coach. The content of our conversation led to her many thought-provoking life questions that eventually got me to reveal my interest in spirituality, and that interest is hers, too. 
            </p>

            <p>She probed about the book I am currently reading titled "Courage: The joy of living dangerously" by the Spiritual Guru Osho, and she was immediately fascinated by it and began reading random lines from the book as we hiked. Apparently, this is the book that is 'exactly what she needed at this stage of her life', discussing about moving into the unknown despite our fears. (And I have lent her the book.) She then shared her experiences of battling with seven years of depression before a Deja-Vu moment that had been 'the best moment of her life' had given her the breakthrough she so needed, and she has viewed life from that point on in a way that was never the same before.
            </p>

            <p>She asked if I believed in synchronicity, and the events that unfolded this week have truly been synchronistic; from the unusually interesting discussions of life and what to do after NS with my colleagues at work, to the embarking of my new projects, and not leaving out this meeting with these new people and the conversation that had been going on between us, there is seemingly a lot of change and newness awaiting me if I would continue to uncover it. "Mark Twain" came up far too many times: I am currently reading a book of his, a colleague mentioned him, a friend recognised him as one of her favourites, I saw his quote(s) somewhere on social media, and today on one of the SUTD brochures kept away in my drawer. 
            </p>

            <p>Even the unpleasant experience that had transpired today during KTV played a role in the bigger picture. It encouraged further self-understanding and a tad more self-love, as well as a deeper introspection of how I would choose to lead my life when we as individuals are truly that small compared to the whole, and asking what the things we want to do are so we could create what truly matters to us. Certainly, it had led me to be writing this.
            </p>

            <p>YL then invited me to the Intro of a Life Coaching programme that piqued my interest - especially so when she said that it delivered her from depression and changed her life - titled "The Courage to Create" (TCC). Perhaps that book had opened up new opportunities for her, and this is an opportunity offered in exchange back to me, too, orchestrated by the vast, divine universe.
            </p>

            <p text-align="center";> What would I choose to create? 
            </p>

            <p text-align="center";> What would we, as an entire human species, like to create from the bottom of our hearts?
            </p>

            <p text-align="center";> When we realise that we are living mediocre lives.
            </p>

            <p text-align="center";> When we realise we could be erased from the vastness of this existence any time and be forgotten forever.
            </p>

            <p text-align="center";> When we realise we have a purpose and a passion yet to be uncovered and yet we could feel that it is present within us - or yet to be lived out.
            </p>

            <p text-align="center";> When we realise that at the moment of our deaths we could take nothing away with us, and leave... 
            </p>

            <p text-align="center";> When that day comes, what have we realised then, that we have <strong><em>within</strong></em> us, that is so much more of value and power? And that is eternal?
            </p>         

   
            <p>My dream is to live a life of freedom by being able to express myself through writing, music, interpersonal communications and deep fulfilling relationships. I enjoy seeing the beauty and sacred in every moment. I long to be able to achieve my health goals, mature as a spiritual being, travel the world and relish different intriguing experiences and be open to it all. I am currently doing yoga and looking forward to learning MMA, and all sorts of adventurous stuffs in the future. That is, if I work toward living my dreams.
            </p>

            <p>But don't ask me how. I have no answer for that - or maybe not for now as discussing that would take a thousand more pages and a thousand more soul-searching moments.
            </p>

            <p>What is your passion? What are your dreams? Can you envision the life you would love to create?
            </p>
