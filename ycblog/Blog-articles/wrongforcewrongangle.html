            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Wrong force, wrong angle</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Feb 17, 2015 by <a href="About.html">yc</a></p>


            <p> <em>It’s your turn now.</em> </p>
            
            <p> Gingerly, I climbed up the ladder with the potential weapon in hand, oblivious to the impending danger I was about to self-inflict. I am now the observed. </p>         

            <p><em> Now, show them your technical skills, not your lack of. </em></p>

            <p>Eyeing the hole in the ceiling and turning my attention back to my object, I found no physical clue. Nonetheless, I reached upward, and began turning it in, clockwise. <em>The “feeling” process, trial and error.</em>  </p>

            <p> Job done, was what I thought when I released my grip after a few turns and the bulb stayed where it was. Yet, a voice from below prompted the inexperienced me to act otherwise. </p> 

            <p><em>“Is it tightly fitted?” </em></p><br/>

            <p>Alright, I thought to myself, perhaps I had applied insufficient force to tighten it, and I meddled with it again, pushing it upward carelessly, exerting force at various angles, hoping to find the right one to secure it. The next thing I heard was a loud crack, followed by gasps from below. I lowered my arm and was greeted by the sight of my bloody red palm. </p>

            <p>Down the ladder I went to my rescue, to Chris who examined my wound, out of the room to the tap at the sink, to helpers who cleaned and bandaged my palm. It is the result of inappropriate force applied at the wrong angles.</p>
            <br/>
            <ol>
            
            <li><h3> Is there something in your life you have been forcing to happen? </h3></li>
            <h4> Letting go of outcomes</h4>
            <p>Letting go of outcomes does not equate to a directionless life where hard work is compromised. “Surrender to God” and “Go with the flow” are common phrases, sometimes misused by religious people or members of the spiritual community. Some people simply drift aimlessly around like a piece of wood in the Ocean, and they don’t find their way to shore. Knowing one’s direction, and taking steps to get there through hard work, is essential. </p>
            <p> In order to flow, it is essential that we are detached from the outcomes we want. On our individual part, we could do our best to make things work. However, insisting that things happen in a certain way, when it is no longer up to us, only places unnecessary pressure and burden on yourself and others around you. One goes into a state of resistance that does not serve any good. </p>
            <p> Our relationships with others is a good test to finding out how attached we are. People tend to be attached to what others think of them, whether others agree with their views, and external validation. People also tend to be attached to what they would get from another person in a relationship, whether it is validation, acceptance, companionship, affection, care, support, financial stability etc. Many relationships begin to fall apart because people could no longer provide each other with what they want. Often, people fail to honour and respect what each other truly wants, as well as each other’s views and beliefs. Instead, they feel the need to change them to make things “right”. </p>
            <p> Thus, for relationships to work, it is important to know who you truly are as a person, rather than unconsciously needing the other to make you whole. Only then could you let go of outcomes and find the right relationship and make things work. </p>
            

            <li><h3> Which angle are you coming from? </h3></li>
            <h4> Openness & Flexibility </h4>
            <p> When we are reluctant to change our angles of approach, we often fail to see how things could work out in other ways. We become rigid and blind. Essentially, we do not realise that there is a door and remain trapped in the room. </p>
            <p> How do we know that a greater gift is not awaiting us on the other side of that door? </p>        
            <p> Seeing different perspectives is an ability to be unattached and fluid in Life. </p>

            <h4> Being clear of your genuine priorities</h4>
            <p> This is about knowing clearly what is important to us, so that we could approach situations from the right angle. Self-awareness is essential. Otherwise, one could be drawn into activities and commitments that are misaligned with one’s main priorities and intentions, potentially causing one to deviate from the right path.  </p>
            <p> For example, my priority may be to pursue my passion in art, but without sufficient self-awareness, opportunities come and I might be pulled into some money-making venture that takes my focus off developing my craft, and instead drives me to earn more money, which is not what I have prioritised in the first place. A good project for me to embark in would be something that allows me to grow and develop my artwork as a main focus, while offering some secondary monetary rewards that can act as both financial support and motivation to further pursue my passion in art. </p>        
            

            <li><h3> Is there an alternative? </h3></li>
            <h4> Living in the question </h4>
            <p> <em>Ask and you shall receive</em> is a law of this universe. However, many people are in a rigid frame of mind, thinking they already have the answers, and they approach life from their judgement and conclusions, from a space where little or no possibilities could emerge. Drop the conclusions and bring the curiosity back. We would not have all the answers. Ask questions, and receive the energy and possibilities that come your way. </p>
            
            <h4> Exploration </h4>
            <p> The willingness to let go of outcomes, stay open to possibilities, find out what our personal truths are, and question what we think we already know, leads us on the path of unlearning and relearning, which is essentially what the spiritual path is about. Growth, change and fulfilment are some of the fruits of labour, should one persevere. </p>
