            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Vulnerability: Communication</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Jan 2, 2015 by <a href="#">yc</a></p>

            <p> During Christmas, in the last few moments leading to Christmas day and the first moments of Christmas, my friend and I broke away from our fellow friends and strangers. We were rather uninterested in the conversation our fellow friends and strangers were trying to maintain at the table where we were seated, and part of me was yearning to join the other group that was having their own Cards Against Humanity game outside the mall, which seems a lot more fun, but we heard they were about to wrap up their activities. We had hardly demonstrated any spontaneous act of participation, by barely uttering a word. After much deliberation and silent discussion via our text messages, my friend bade the group goodbye and we left with another friend, but that act had been a misunderstanding and a miscommunication, for I wanted to be involved with the other group who were about to join us. She felt bad and tried to make me go back, but after much back and forth, we found ourselves wandering aimlessly through the streets of Town with only each other as company under the night sky. I saw this as a mini adventure, as this was the rarest of times I had actually stayed out late into the night and had no urgency to get home.</p>
            
            <p> Eventually, we found a place under a large building, where we sat down and opened up our Christmas gifts. She mulled over how it could be her words that might have upset our sensitive friend, and felt bad for it. I argued that it wasn't her fault, that an innocent remark could be poison to another depending on their interpretations, judgement or their filters that cloud reality, and just as an innocent child does whatever he wishes authentically with no deliberation or fear, we could just choose to worry less about the things we say as long as our words aren't deceiving ourselves and others.</p>         

            <p> She opened up a new doorway so that I could see a more insightful and enlightening way of communication. <strong>The art of vulnerability and openness.</strong> It wasn't that I wasn't open in the first place, but I lacked initiative. Once, my friend placed a necklace that is a religious personal item on the hotel table, and being oblivious I was about to attempt to pull out a piece of cloth or paper from underneath it, and my friend was offended, asking if I have any regard for his item. His frustration and anger bombarded my space, and I felt frustrated in the way he responded, too. As I was processing these events, under some pressure to respond to his question, I had probably said, "I don't believe in your religion". My friend was even more offended after that, when he brought it up about a month later, but I could not remember my words. I understand that any human being might have been offended by my words. In that moment that had been all I could utter.</p>

            <p>I knew there had been a lot of differences and unhappiness between us throughout the trip, not that it had been ruined by these events but they certainly had left negative footprints that had dampened our moods to an extent. I wanted to talk during the trip itself but my friend was not open to listening or talking about anything as he chose to simply enjoy his time there. After we had returned to Singapore we only met up a month later and he broke this to me when he was trying to put a point across in our conversation.</p>

            <p>Believe me when I say that my statement "I don't believe in your religion" is not meant to carry any malice but just one of the thoughts in my head at that time. Most people would take it to be an insult, a further elaboration would be "I don't believe in your religion so I don't give a damn if I pull off the paper from underneath and your necklace that means so much religiously to you drops to the ground. I was thinking to myself "I don't believe in your religion so I don't know how much that item means to you (and I'm frustrated that you're so frustrated at me over that small matter) - I may know it mentally but don't really feel its importance, so it doesn't sink in that I really shouldn't be pulling the necklace off even if I've noticed it". Personally, I do not have religious items that I have to take care of, so I wouldn't comprehend how bad it would be for such a thing to happen, for someone to do that. But all I could manage to say at that time was "I don't believe in your religion". The moment my friend had took offense, my barriers and defenses are up and my ego had taken over such that there couldn't be any vulnerability in the moment. I wasn't ready to meet his intensity of anger and felt bombarded by such energy that I just said what directly came to mind because I felt pressured to respond, without bothering to explain myself.</p>

            <p>She also brought up her past incidences, and how the use of the word "sorry" can effectively bring about communication, providing my with another insight. It does not always have to be "Sorry, I'm wrong, I shouldn't have done that". It could be <strong>"Sorry that I have caused such dissatisfaction and unhappiness between us (because I treasure our relationship and would hate for it to be ruined over something as insignificant as this)" that can be followed by "Can we talk about it?" </strong>It is a vulnerable way of communication of first relinquishing the defenses of my own ego - probably by being mindful enough to observe it first - so I could receive the other person's perspective, and the other person's barriers and defenses are lowered too by such vulnerability. Furthermore, it is not out of integrity, or saying sorry for the sake of making up while denying your own frustration, anger or guilt. It is authenticity.

            <p>When the other person isn't willing to let go of his judgement or realise it, there is nothing I could do to change it. Thus, what I could do is bring about communication and an understanding of why he/she had reacted the way he/she did, and fully accepting that response without attempting to make him wrong for it. After all, it is the art of seeing a situation - the reality of what had occurred - from two different angles, and there is no wrong or right one. Understanding comes when both parties could see each other's perspectives. <strong>And the objective in communication is not to arrive at what should have been the right thing to do or who is wrong, but it is mutual understanding.</strong></p>

            <p>All throughout the previous week I have been discussing and working on an event with a friend. After so many communication lapses and pondering lately, I began to feel bad when we disagree over certain things and he usually gives in to me as I'm firmer with my opinions. Although I may feel that my perspectives are better and I could explain them reasonably, my friend's perspectives will be "inferior" only if I make them so. They are just two different perspectives that we could not agree on. I guess, it is to give up on what I would think is ideal. It would be best if both parties could keep communication going to reach an ideal conclusion for both, Otherwise, it would still be more honouring of the other person by giving in sometimes and not narrow things down to what is ideal and what isn't.</p>
